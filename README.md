## CANDLE
This project is aimed at demonstrating inheritance and composition using the object candle.

* **Composition**: This occurs when a Class **HAS** other objects. In this example, the candle class **has** Wix, Wax, Fragrance and colour.
* **Inheritance**: This occurs when a class is derived from another class. There are many examples of Inheritance in this project.
    * The **ElectronicCandle** is inherited from **Candle**
    * The **LavenderFragrance** is inherited from **Fragrance**
